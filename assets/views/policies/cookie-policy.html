        <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This Cookie Policy is provided as a template. Please review it
        carefully, fill in the specific details accurately reflecting your website's cookie usage,

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This Cookie Policy explains how Jissicko Software ("we", "us", "our") uses cookies and similar
      tracking technologies on our Pictora application and associated website(s) (collectively, the
      "Service"), accessible via [Your Website URL, e.g., pictora.com]. It explains what these
      technologies are, why we use them, and your rights to control our use of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This policy should be read alongside our
      <a href="/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Policy</a>, which
      provides more detailed information about how we handle your personal data.
    </p>

    <h2>2. What Are Cookies?</h2>
    <p>
      Cookies are small data files placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website
      or use an application. They are widely used to make websites and applications work, or work
      more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Jissicko Software) are called "first-party
      cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party
      cookies". Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on
      or through the website (e.g., analytics, advertising, interactive content).
    </p>
    <p>
      Cookies can remain on your device for different periods. "Session cookies" exist only while
      your browser is open and are deleted automatically once you close your browser. "Persistent
      cookies" survive after your browser is closed and can be used by the website to recognize your
      computer when you return.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Why Do We Use Cookies?</h2>
    <p>
      We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for
      technical reasons in order for our Service to operate â€“ these are referred to as "necessary"
      or "essential" cookies. Other cookies enable us to track usage patterns and enhance the
      experience on our Service (Analytics), and potentially to help deliver relevant marketing
      messages (Marketing).
    </p>

    <h2>4. Types of Cookies Used on Pictora</h2>
    <p>We classify the cookies used on our Service as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Necessary Cookies:</strong> These are strictly necessary to provide you with the
          core services available through Pictora and to use some of its essential features, such as
          secure login, session management, and security functions. Because these cookies are
          strictly necessary to deliver the Service, you cannot refuse them without impacting how
          the Service functions. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings (see
          Section 7 below), but this may affect Service functionality.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Analytics Cookies (Performance Cookies):</strong> These cookies collect
          information about how you use our Service, for instance, which features you use most
          often, how long you spend on certain tasks, and if you receive error messages. This
          information helps us understand usage patterns, improve the performance and usability of
          Pictora, and enhance our AI models. We use Google Analytics for this purpose. These
          cookies are only placed and used if you provide your consent via our cookie management
          tool.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Marketing Cookies (Targeting Cookies):</strong> These cookies may be used to
          understand user interests, track the effectiveness of our own marketing campaigns (e.g.,
          user acquisition), or potentially work with advertising partners (like Meta/Facebook) to
          show you relevant ads on other platforms. These cookies record your visit to our Service
          and potentially your browsing activity elsewhere. These cookies are only placed and used
          if you provide your consent via our cookie management tool.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Specific Cookies We Use (Examples)</h2>

    <h2>6. Third-Party Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      As indicated above, certain features or functionalities of our Service rely on third-party
      providers who may set their own cookies on your device. This includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Google Analytics:</strong> To analyze website traffic and usage. Google's use of
        data is governed by their own policies.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Meta (Facebook) Pixel:</strong> For tracking conversions from Facebook ads,
        optimizing ads, and building targeted audiences. Meta's use of data is governed by their own
        policies.
      </li>
      <li>
        [List any other significant third parties setting cookies, e.g., payment processors if they
        set persistent tracking cookies, embedded video providers, etc.]
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These third parties control the cookies they set. We recommend you review their respective
      privacy and cookie policies for more information on how they use cookies and process data.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Your Choices and Managing Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies other than Necessary cookies.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Cookie Consent Tool:</strong> When you first visit our Service, you will be
          presented with a cookie banner allowing you to accept all cookies, reject non-essential
          cookies, or manage your preferences for specific categories (Analytics, Marketing). You
          can typically change your preferences at any time by clicking on a "Cookie Settings" or
          "Manage Consent" link or button (usually found in the website footer). [Ensure such a
          link/button exists and is functional]. Rejecting cookies via this tool will prevent
          Analytics and Marketing cookies from being set or used going forward.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Browser Settings:</strong> Most web browsers allow you to control cookies through
          their settings preferences. You can set your browser to block or delete cookies. However,
          if you block all cookies (including Necessary ones), you may not be able to access all or
          parts of our Service, and some functionality may be impaired. Find out how to manage
