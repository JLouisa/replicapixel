    <p>
      The headings used in this agreement are included for convenience only and will not limit or

    </p>

    <h3>SECTION 3 - ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS AND TIMELINESS OF INFORMATION & AI OUTPUT</h3>

    <p>
      We are not responsible if information made available about the <strong>Service</strong> (e.g.,
      feature descriptions, documentation) is not accurate, complete or current. Such material is
      provided for general information only and should not be relied upon as the sole basis for
      making decisions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <strong>Service</strong> utilizes complex AI models (including Lora models) to generate
      content like images and videos based on user inputs. You acknowledge that AI-generated content
      can sometimes be unpredictable, inaccurate, may exhibit biases present in the training data,
      or may not perfectly match your intended outcome. We make no warranties regarding the
      accuracy, quality, suitability, or factuality of the generated content. Any reliance on the
      material or generated content from this <strong>Service</strong> is at your own risk.
    </p>

    <p>
      This site or application may contain certain historical information regarding features or
      service levels. Historical information, necessarily, is not current and is provided for your
      reference only. We reserve the right to modify the contents of the
      <strong>Service</strong> (including features, UI, and available models) at any time, but we
      have no obligation to update any specific information or maintain legacy features. You agree
      that it is your responsibility to monitor changes to our <strong>Service</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>SECTION 4 - MODIFICATIONS TO THE SERVICE AND PRICES</h3>

    <p>
      Prices for using our <strong>Service</strong> (e.g., subscription fees, credit packs) are
      subject to change without notice.
    </p>

    <p>
      We reserve the right at any time to modify or discontinue the <strong>Service</strong> (or any
      part or content thereof, including specific AI models or features) without notice at any time.
    </p>

    <p>
      We shall not be liable to you or to any third-party for any modification, price change,
      suspension or discontinuance of the <strong>Service</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>SECTION 5 - THE SERVICE AND GENERATED CONTENT</h3>

    <p>
      The <strong>Service</strong> allows users to generate digital content, such as images and
      videos, using artificial intelligence technologies based on user-provided inputs (e.g., text
      prompts).
    </p>

    <p>
      We have made efforts to provide tools and options, but the nature of AI means we cannot
      guarantee specific results or that the generated output will meet every expectation or be free
      from artifacts or inconsistencies.
    </p>

    <p>
      We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to limit the use of our
      <strong>Service</strong> to any person, geographic region or jurisdiction. We may exercise
      this right on a case-by-case basis. We reserve the right to limit the quantities or types of
      Services (e.g., number of generations, resolution limits) that we offer.
    </p>

    <p>
      We reserve the right to discontinue any feature or aspect of the <strong>Service</strong> at
      any time.
    </p>

    <p>
      We do not warrant that the quality of the <strong>Service</strong> or any generated content,
      information, or other material obtained by you will meet your specific expectations, or that
      any errors in the <strong>Service</strong> will be corrected.
    </p>

    <h4>5.1 - Content Ownership and Usage Rights</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>Your Input:</strong> You retain ownership of the original prompts or other input
      materials you provide to the <strong>Service</strong>. You represent and warrant that you have
      all necessary rights to provide this input to us and that it does not violate any third-party
      rights or applicable laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Generated Output:</strong> Subject to your compliance with these
      <strong>Terms</strong>, and depending on your subscription level or plan (if applicable),
      <strong>Jissicko Software</strong> grants you ownership rights to the specific images or
      videos you generate using the <strong>Service</strong> ("Output").
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>License to Us:</strong> You grant <strong>Jissicko Software</strong> a non-exclusive,
      worldwide, royalty-free, sub-licensable license to use, reproduce, modify, and display your
      input prompts and generated Output solely for the purposes of operating, improving, and
      promoting the <strong>Service</strong>. For example, we may use inputs and outputs to
      fine-tune our AI models or showcase anonymized examples of generated content. We will not use
      your specific inputs or outputs for direct marketing without your explicit permission.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Usage Restrictions:</strong> Your use of the Output is subject to the restrictions

      privacy, publicity rights).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Due to the nature of AI, similar inputs may generate similar
      outputs for different users. We cannot guarantee the uniqueness of any Output. You use the
      Output at your own risk, and <strong>Jissicko Software</strong> disclaims any liability
      related to your use of the Output.
    </p>

    <h3>SECTION 6 - ACCURACY OF BILLING AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION</h3>

      We reserve the right to refuse any order or subscription request you place with us. We may, in
      our sole discretion, limit or cancel purchased credits or subscription access per person, per
      household or per order/account. These restrictions may include orders placed by or under the
      same customer account, the same credit card, and/or accounts that use the same billing
      information.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the event that we make a change to or cancel an order/subscription, we may attempt to
      notify you by contacting the e-mail and/or billing address/phone number provided at the time
      the order was made.
